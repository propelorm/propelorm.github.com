# Compatibility Index

## Databases

Some features are not available through all PDO supported databases. You can see here a list
of primary limitations.

At the moment we list only MySQL, SQLite and Postgres since only those are unit tested and fully supported.


### Foreign Keys

|  Functionality   |  MySQL |   SQLite    | Postgres
|------------------|--------|-------------|---------
| General          |   Yes  |  Partial(1) |    Yes
| `name` attribute |   Yes  |  No(2)      |    Yes

1) As of version 3.6.19, SQLite supports foreign key constraints.

2) SQLite does not support named foreignKeys.


### Other

|  Functionality                        |  MySQL |    SQLite   | Postgres
|---------------------------------------|--------|-------------|---------
| Multiple autoincrement                |   Yes  |  No(1)      |   Yes
| Composite PK with one autoIncrement   |   Yes  |  Partial(2) |   Yes
| `index-column` size attribute         |   Yes  |  Np(3)      |   No(3)

1) SQLite does not support multiple columns with autoIncrement set to true.

2) SQLite does not support a composite PK where one of these is a autoIncrement. We support it anyways because
we're setting primaryKey=false and create a unique constraint instead, which is at the end basically the same.

3) Only MySQL supports a concrete size at a `index-column`.


## PHP Versions

Update PHP to version 5.5 or upper.
